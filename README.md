# 🖼️ OpenCV Operations  

This repository showcases various **image processing operations** using OpenCV. Each script demonstrates a unique operation, including **blurring**, **contour detection**, **circle dropping**, **edge detection**, and **face detection**.  

---

## 🔧 Requirements  

Before running any script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install opencv-python

## 📂 Files and Functionality  

### 1. ✨ **Bluroperation.py**  
- Applies different **blurring techniques** to an image, including:  
  - Gaussian Blur  
  - Median Blur  
  - Bilateral Filter  

---

### 2. 🔲 **contour_detection.py**  
- Detects contours in an image and highlights them.  
- Useful for identifying **object boundaries and shapes**.  

---

### 3. 🔵 **drop_circle.py**  
- Draws circles on a canvas or image at **random** or **user-defined positions**.  
- Demonstrates drawing **geometric shapes** using OpenCV.  

---

### 4. ✂️ **edge.py**  
- Applies **edge detection** using the **Canny edge detection algorithm**.  
- Helps in **image segmentation** and **object detection** by outlining edges in an image.  

---

### 5. 🙂 **face.py**  
- Performs **face detection** using OpenCV's Haar cascades.  
- Identifies and marks faces in an input image or video stream.
